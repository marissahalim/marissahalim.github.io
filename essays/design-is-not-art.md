# Is Design Art?
  There are going to be people who disagree with me on this but I believe that Design and Art are *not* synonomous with each other. Originally, I always thought that 
  design was art because it was aesthetically pleasing and incorporated elements of Art such as space, color, value, line, etc. However, after talking to friends
  pursuing graphic design and literally seeing the phrase "Design is not Art" all over my Instagram feed, I've learned that they are indeed different. The special 
  thing about Design is that it has a function, i.e., a job. A great example of this concept is logo design. There is so much thought that goes into each line, 
  color choice, font, etc. into those simple but impactful designs that identify a company's brand. When a brand wants a logo, they want it to fit this simple pattern:
  it must be recognizable either blown up or shrunken down, not too messy or chaotic where the viewer gets confused, able to be seen even when black or white,
  and most importantly, convey the company's unique identity. Not following this criteria could result in a logo that isn't memorable or is just unappealing. 
  Iconic logo designs include

  Graphic Designers always have these design patterns, or rules, in mind when creating something to solve a problem for their client. Likewise, the same idea of design 
  patterns is applied to software engineering practices. 

# Design patterns from a SWE perspective and my experience using them
  While actual design patterns in graphic design and software engineering differ, the concept is the same: design patterns are used to solve problems. I just started learning about design patterns and the most shocking thing I learned is that I've already been using them in coding homeworks and projects! I can finally put a name to the strategies I've been taught to incorporate into my work. The design patterns I have learned so far include Singleton, Model-View-Controller (MVC), Observer, Factory, Publish-Subscribe, Prototype, and Front Controller. Currently, I'm working on a web application called Budget Munchies with 3 other classmates and its purpose is to allow college students to create a community where they can share and keep track of healthy, affordable recipes that they want to try/have tried. After thinking about which design patterns have been applied to the project, I have concluded that Budget Munchies incorporates the Singleton and MVC design patterns.
