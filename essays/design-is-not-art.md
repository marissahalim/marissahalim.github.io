### Is Design Art?
  There are going to be people who disagree with me on this but I believe that Design and Art are *not* synonomous with each other. Originally, I always thought that 
  design was art because it was aesthetically pleasing and incorporated elements of Art such as space, color, value, line, etc. However, after talking to friends
  pursuing graphic design and literally seeing the phrase "Design is not Art" all over my Instagram feed, I've learned that they are indeed different. The special 
  thing about Design is that it has a function, i.e., a job. A great example of this concept is logo design. There is so much thought that goes into each line, 
  color choice, font, etc. into those simple but impactful designs that identify a company's brand. When a brand wants a logo, they want it to fit this simple pattern:
  it must be recognizable either blown up or shrunken down, not too messy or chaotic where the viewer gets confused, able to be seen even when black or white,
  and most importantly, convey the company's unique identity. Not following this criteria could result in a logo that isn't memorable or is just unappealing. 
  Great logo designs include Nike's swoosh ![Nike logo](https://www.clipartkey.com/mpngs/m/55-558096_svg-vector-nike-logo.png)

  Graphic Designers always have these design patterns, or rules, in mind when creating something to solve a problem for their client. Likewise, the same idea of design 
  patterns is applied to software engineering practices.
