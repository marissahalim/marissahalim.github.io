## Why I am a Javascript Noob
This is the first time I've ever touched Javascript and so far, it's been a great experience. When I first started to learn how to code (with Java), I always needed to refer to examples because I kept making sytax errors. Now that I have experience coding in different languages, I was able to pick up Javascript syntax much faster. But, since I'm a total newbie, I can only solve problems with code that works. I'm still working on learning how to code concisely and elegantly while applying language-specific features. 
## Javascript's Versatility
From a software engineer perspective, I think Javascript is a great programming language because it is versatile. It can be used for both front-end and back-end development which isn't the case for some other languages. I really like how it is easy to pick up Javascript. I've learned C/C++ from school and tried to self-teach myself Python but it was harder for me to learn and get comfortable. 
## Pros of Athletic SWE
I think athletic software engineering is really useful and effective in teaching students how to think on their feet while solving problems. It forces you to really think through everything you've learned and apply what you know is best. As someone who panics easily, I find timed activities to be very stressful but I know that they are incredibly helpful. With exercises like WODs, there's no time to dwell on your mistakes. You need to figure out where you went wrong, remember, and move on to the next problem. As time goes on and you learn more, you only get better. I think this style of learning will work for me because it causes me to remember my mistakes and apply what I learned more efficiently.
