If you were wondering based on the title, yes, I can actually code a navbar in under a minute: 39 seconds to be exact. It was also only done in my HTML file!
```
  <div class="ui menu">
    <a class="item">Home</a>
    <a class="item">Menu</a>
    <a class="item">About Us</a>
  </div>
```
<img align="center" width="40%" height="40%" src="../images/easyNavBar.PNG"> <br>
While it is not functional (adding the links for reference would take a bit more time) nor pretty, it at least *looks* like a navbar. Since last summer, I tried to learn HTML and CSS on my own because I wanted to explore web design. During my journey, I attempted to make a navigation bar and looking back at my experience, it was just ... pure pain.
