If you were wondering based on the title, yes, I can actually code a navbar in under a minute. I did it specifically for this and it ended up being exactly 39 seconds. It was also only done in my HTML file!
```
  <div class="ui menu">
    <a class="item">Home</a>
    <a class="item">Menu</a>
    <a class="item">About Us</a>
  </div>
```
<img align="center" width="40%" height="40%" src="../images/easyNavBar.PNG"> <br>
While it is not functional (adding the links for reference would take a bit more time) nor pretty, it at least *looks* like a navbar. Since last summer, I've been trying to learn HTML and CSS on my own because I wanted to explore web design. During my journey, I attempted to make a navigation bar and looking back at my result, it was just ... pure pain. The navbar and code above is all thanks to the wonderful Semantic UI, a framework that makes front-end development so much smoother. I'm so glad I was introduced to Semantic UI because now, those painful days with raw HTML and CSS are over. (Though, that's not to say that I'll never have stress from  Semantic UI because I definitely have experienced *severe* frustration already.)
