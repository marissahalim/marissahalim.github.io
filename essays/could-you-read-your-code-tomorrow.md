## Life Before Knowing About Coding Standards
In high school, I didn't know anything about coding standards. I just started learning Java and the only thing that mattered was preparing for the AP exam in May. I only focused on being able to solve a problem at that moment so I never paid attention to coding standards and man would that *kick* my butt the next day. Since some projects took a few days, I would have to revisit code but because it didn't have any comments or follow standards, I spent too much time trying to read old code  instead of adding on to a file. Those were rough days.

## Learning About Coding Standards
I was first introduced to coding standards in my ICS 211 class. There were many new habits I needed to fix that ranged from spacing, indentation, CamelCase, etc. but for that class, the most important thing I learned was how and when to properly comment. Commenting allowed me to leave little notes for my future self so that I would know what each method would do and what each variable was for. Because I made commenting a habit, I was less confused when I continued working on a project that I left to the side.

## I Thought ESLint Hated Me
You may think this title is weird but I truly believed this at first. I spent 3 hours trying to install ESLint and it *still* was not enough.
