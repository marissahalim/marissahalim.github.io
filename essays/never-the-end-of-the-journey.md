## It's All Coming to an End
Tomorrow will be the last day for my Software Engineering I course and I think I've come a long way. I've learned a lot and gained valuable experience through my final project Budget Munchies. I've learned numerous concepts that can be applied to future careers such as: 
* Open Source Software Development
* Configuration Management
* Functional Programming
* Development Environments
* Coding Standards
* User Interface Frameworks
* Agile Project Management
* Design Patterns
* Ethics in Software Engineering



## Group Projects

## Shorter Code but Just as Efficient

## Faster and Easier Design Implementation
