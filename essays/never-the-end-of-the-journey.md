## It's All Coming to an End
Tomorrow will be the last day for my Software Engineering I course and I think I've come a long way. Before jumping into this class, I didn't know what to expect to learn. At that point, my understanding of software engineering was juvenile which left me floundering at the beginning. But, as I took it assignment by assignment, I discovered that software engineering is a multitude of concepts that can be applied to future careers such as: 
* Open Source Software Development
* Configuration Management
* Functional Programming
* Development Environments
* Coding Standards
* User Interface Frameworks
* Agile Project Management
* Design Patterns
* Ethics in Software Engineering
 I espacially learned a lot and gained valuable experience through my final project Budget Munchies. While people outside the computer science world may think that software engineering is *just* coding, I'd like to show them that that statement is wrong. Software engineering is not only coding but also ethics, effectiveness, discipline, and design. While learning Javascript and ESC (ECMAScript 6), I was introduced to the Underscore library which changed how concise I could code without giving up effeciency. Coding standards is all about discipline but it's there for a reason: to keep code organized and legible. Ethics can be seen in open source software development whether it's like the unethical experiment conducted by students from the University of Minnesota against the Linux Kernel or being courteous while asking questions on sites like Stack Overflow or CodeProject. 
## Group Projects
In Spring 2021, I had my first huge (at least to me) group project. I was in a group with three other classmates and the objective of our project was to create a web application that allowed college students to efficiently share easy, budget-friendly recipes within a communinity. This is where Issue-Developed Project Management comes in, also known as IDPM. 
## Shorter Code but Just as Efficient

## Faster and Easier Design Implementation
