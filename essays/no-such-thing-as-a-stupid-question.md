According to Carl Sagan: 
> There are naive questions, tedious questions, ill-phrased questions, questions put after inadequate self-criticism. But every question is a cry to understand the world. There is no such thing as a dumb question.

Questions are essential to life. If we ask questions, this means we are curious and constantly learning.
