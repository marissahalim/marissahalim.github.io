## Objective
For the final project of my Software Engineer I class, I worked together with three other people to create a functional website that would allow college students to share recipes in a community and connect with vendors in the university's area. Functions we included for users were the ability to add a recipe, like a recipe, view your own recipes and edit them if needed, browse through a variety of recipes posted by the community, view vendors and leave comments of their experience with them. We were given   weeks to have a final project so in order to get work done, we assigned three people wo work on the website and the other person to do the home page and testing. 

## End Results
Although there were many bumps along the road, my group and I eventually ended up with a product that I am pretty proud to have contributed to. This experience has especially taught me how to persevere whenever problems arise. While not ideal, I found that experiencing the frustration is all part of the process.
